    <p style = "font-size:21px;">

      Berger mentions how a large part of seeing depends upon habits and convention. I thought that was especially true because different people see art in different ways based on their past experiences and the views that were shaped by those experiences. I also thought it was interesting how he mentions the eye and our perspective centers everything, however a camera can show all the angles that you wouldn’t see with the eye. In addition, I think it’s important how he also covers image reproduction - and mentions how a camera can reproduce the image, making it available in any size for any purpose (paintings). I think this is very sad because it takes away the value, meaning, and uniqueness of the art.

I’ve never thought about the idea of naked vs nude before. In my eyes, they were basically the same thing. I thought it was very intriguing how Berger explained that being naked is simply being without clothes, but nude is a form of art. "To be naked is to be oneself. To be nude is to be seen naked by others and yet not recognized for oneself. A naked body has to be seen as an object in order to become a nude”

When Berger compared art galleries to palaces and banks, I thought of how the art in museums is really like money sitting inside a bank - except that the art is literally on display and everyone knows the value. Images that are desirable are stolen. This adds to Berger’s idea that oil painting/other art exists to depict owners wealth and that the subject isn't really art. I also thought it was true how “A publicity picture suggests that if we buy what is offered, our life will be different from what it is”. I thought of social media and why many of us buy into the products being promoted by famous people. “Influencers” and celebrities often post about their unattainable lifestyle - which many of us want to live - so when they post products that they use, we think that somehow if we used the same products as them, we too can achieve that lifestyle.
