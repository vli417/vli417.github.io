      Written in 1945, it is both fascinating and a bit frightening that some of the technological advances Vannevar Bush writes about in his article “As We May Think” actually exist today. While reading the article, I thought to myself how it’s a bit scary just how advanced some of the technology/gadgets he described was…until I realized that many of them basically exist in our society today. (or at least some version of what he described). When Bush writes about the “spider web of metal, sealed in a thin glass container, a wire heated to brilliant glow”, I realized that is basically what a phone is. When he described the “camera hound of the future” and how someone “wears on his forehead a lump a little larger than a walnut. It takes pictures 3 millimeters square, later to be projected or enlarged, which after all involves only a factor of 10 beyond present practice”, google glass is essentially what he was describing. Bush also mentioned “Compression is important, however, when it comes to costs”. That is probably why our software devices have become smaller and smaller.
      Bush tells the story of the girl at the World Fair and how there could be a machine that types when talked to in the future. It’s amazing how so many computer/phone/tablet programs now have speech to text or text to speech features where users can talk and it will type for them. (ex: google docs) Bush is essentially predicting modern day computers and laptops when he writes “Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and, to coin one at random, "memex" will do. A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory”. Our devices are files and libraries of memory and information and we can access it with the exceeding speed and flexibility that he talks about. In summary, Bush was right about the advances, its effect on society, and how it makes our lives easier by allowing swift communication and easily accessible information.
