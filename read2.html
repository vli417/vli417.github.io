      I think that Tim Berners Lee talks about topics regarding the web and internet that many people shy away from because it takes away from the hope of further web advancements and exciting social trends. Some of the topics he writes about that I think are very important are how the web can be used by governments in ways that endangers human rights and also how social networking sites can take away from the fundamental web values. And as he warns “If we, the Web’s users, allow these and other trends to proceed unchecked, the Web could be broken into fragmented islands. We could lose the freedom to connect with whichever Web sites we want. The ill effects could extend to smartphones and ipads, which are also portals to the extensive information that the Web provides”. Relating to Vannevar Bush’s 1945 article, it is interesting how Bush predicted so much into the future and his predictions were so advanced, yet Tim Berners Lee is afraid of the web being destructed. That means that even though many of Bush’s predictions came true already, the web might be broken before time allows Bush’s more advanced technology to exist.
I also found it interesting how if we look deeper into social networking sites, instead of connecting people, it actually isolates users. As Lee explains “The isolation occurs because each piece of information does not have a URI. Connections among data exist only within a site. So the more you enter, the more you become locked in”. Lee also mentions a related danger when “one social-networking site—or one search engine or one browser—gets so big that it becomes a monopoly, which tends to limit innovation”. This reminded me of the Facebook controversy that's happened in recent years.
